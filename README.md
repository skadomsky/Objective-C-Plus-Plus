User Defined Languages (UDL) is a feature of [Notepad++ editor](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), allowing user to define syntax 
highlights / folding rules of any programming languages. This UDL highlights some fundamental classes in Cocoa, keywords in C++/
Objective-C, and escape characters in Objective-C++ programming languages.
